Computer Science Standards
============

This project involves casting the Computer Science Teachers Association's (CSTA) Computer Science standards into the format followed by the Great Schools Partnership (GSP).

One issue that teachers deal with when working with discipline-specific standards is that every set of standards has a slightly different structure. So when we plan classes, materials, assessments, and reporting mechanisms we have to rethink each subject area differently. Of all the systems for organizing standards, I like the GSP model best. This project is an attempt to cast the CSTA standards into the GSP model, and see if it makes the standards more useful.

GSP Model

Briefly, the GSP model is structured as follows:

- Subject Area
  - Focus Area
    - Competency Area
      - Performance Indicator
        - Learning Objective
