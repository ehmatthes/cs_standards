Computer Science Standards
============

This project involves casting the Computer Science Teachers Association's (CSTA) Computer Science standards into the format followed by the Great Schools Partnership (GSP).

One issue that teachers deal with when working with discipline-specific standards is that every set of standards has a slightly different structure. So when we plan classes, materials, assessments, and reporting mechanisms we have to rethink each subject area differently. Of all the systems for organizing standards, I like the GSP model best. This project is an attempt to cast the CSTA standards into the GSP model, and see if it makes the standards more useful.

This project uses one significant departure from the GSP model. GSP has what it calls "Graduation Standards" within each subject area or focus area. This is a little confusing, because not all graduation standards are required for graduation. We choose to call these "Competency Areas", because they designate the areas in which someone needs to demonstrate competency in order to be considered proficient in that area. In the complete set of standards that a school uses, some competency areas are required for graduation.

Briefly, the GSP model is structured as follows:

- Subject Area
  - Focus Area
    - Competency Area (Graduation Standard)
      - Performance Indicator
        - Learning Objective

It's overwhelming to put all of the CSTA standards into the GSP format at once. I'm starting by including the standards I'm aiming to reach in my fall Introduction to Programming class.

If you want to help, please let me know. There are a number of things that can be done, so let me know what your priorities are, and we'll agree on a way to move the overall project forward.
